Squirrel Tracking System

This is a web application that tracks the information of squirrels in Central Park. Users can check sightings of squirrels, edit, add and delete sightings. Besides, the statistics of the numbers of adult, running, climbing, eating squirrels and their fur colors are shown in /sightings/stats/. We add a link "All Squirrel Sightings" on the top of this page, which can redirect users to the page /sightings/. Also, users can view 100 sightings among all squirrels on the map. When they click on each point on the map, the unique squirrel ID of that sighting will be shown.
